In my opinion, no matter how big or small your business is, it's crucial to start using different tools to optimize your workflow right away. What about API? You can find out more about such systems for business management by just googling or directly on the developer team's website [https://binary-studio.com/api-development/](https://binary-studio.com/api-development/). With a custom API system, you won't have to worry about data security and quick recovery in case of a failure. Plus, you'll get maximum control over the situation.
